IT apprenticeships firm QA Apprenticeships needed a central hub for their community to nurture leads as well as extend their customer service offering. My team and I managed their Facebook account to spread industry news, invite engagement and interact with users in innovative and unique ways.

During the time I was in charge of their social offering, QA overtook main competitor Zenos in regards to brand volume and share-of-voice online.
