Aster Homes deemed their website insufficient to both harbour a community and generate new lead opportunities. Working with the design and development departments, I wrote and devised 3 bespoke Facebook landing pages centred on Aster Homes' geographic catchment areas. These pages included downloadable content, regional information and property listings.

The work I have undertaken for Aster Homes' Facebook presence has resulted in their cancellation of a Rightmove subscription, instead hosting their entire property listings on the Facebook tab.
