Online brand awareness and lead opportunities for a specific property development in Bristol were being dominated by a competitor. This Facebook page enabled Aster Homes to portray their greater service offering as well as superior customer service. 

The copy needed to incorporate unique content and apartment layout/information. As a result of the copy written and work undertaken by myself on the Facebook tab, Aster Homes sold their entire portfolio for the development in 3 months.
