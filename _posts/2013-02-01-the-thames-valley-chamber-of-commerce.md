Requiring content to exhale the virtues of foreign investment in the Thames Valley, a series of Whitepapers were created. These were written following interviews with international brands based in the region, such as Cisco and HSBC.

These whitepapers played a major contributing facor in the acquisition of 2 new site sponsors, as well as forming the basis for a variety of social conversations.
