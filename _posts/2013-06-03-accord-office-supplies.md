Realising that they were being digitally out-manoeuvred by competitors Office Thingy and Irongate, Accord Office Supplies needed a social presence that demonstrated their green credentials and morepersonalised customer services. 

My team and I took on their LinkedIn and Twitter activity, engaging with key influencers in a friendly, approachable yet professional tone. Through interactive and innovative copy, we have achieved a Twitter engagement ratio of over 35% and close to 200 click-throughs back to the website every month on LinkedIn.
