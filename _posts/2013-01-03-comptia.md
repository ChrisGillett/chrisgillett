IT certification vender CompTIA had the specific campaign goal of encouraging those struggling to progress their IT career to embark in their programmes. The copy focussed on the means by which it was possible to achieve a 'Â£60k career', utilising CompTIA's certification and product offerings. 

Through the character of 'Rocket Man', users were encouraged that CompTIA would help 'launch' and 'boost' their IT careers. Achieving over 2000 unique leads, the campaign was hailed as a major success.
